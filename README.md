### To kickstart the boilerplate, provide a `.env` file with your `PRISMIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` && `PRISMIC_ENDPOINT`, then run the following commands:

```bash
yarn

yarn dev
```

### If you do not have yarn installed, delete the `yarn.lock` file and install via npm,

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

### Or install yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```
